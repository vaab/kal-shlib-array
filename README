Install
=======


From source
-----------

Consider this release as Very Alpha. Use at your own risk. It may or may not
upgrade to a more user friendly version in future, depending on my spare time.

Nethertheless, this package support GNU install quite well so a simple::

    ./configure && make && make install

Should work (and has been tested and is currently used).

Note: you can specify a '--prefix=/your/location'


From debian package
-------------------

A debian package repository is available at:

    deb http://deb.kalysto.org no-dist kal-alpha

you should include this repository to your apt system and then:

    apt-get update && apt-get install kal-shlib-array


What does contain this package ?
---------------------------------

Libraries which are files called 'lib*.sh' installed in
  $PREFIX/lib/shlib/

The debian package version will install directly to this location
(knowing that prefix is "/").


Usage
=====

TBD
